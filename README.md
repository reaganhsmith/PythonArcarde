# Overview
I really love video games and think the idea behind them is fun and exciting. I useed Python Arcade and Tile to write my own video game. With python arcade I was able to create a player that can run and jump around the map. It uses physics and gravity to get the player to work. It also gets controls from the players keyboard. I also was able to add sound effects with python arcade. So when the user dies, collects fruit or jumps there is audio output. There is so much you can do with python arcade and it was fun getting a glimpse into the possibilities. 

I like that you get to use your creativity to create games and can have an imagination!! For this project I decided to use python arcade to build my own game. I also used Tiled to create the map for the game. I had a really fun time setting up the game and making it user friendly and fun!The user plays as a cat that goes and collects fruit and needs to avoid the grape lava. Each piece of fruit is worth 10 points. 


I wrote this software because I am very passionate about video games and think thye are very fun. I want to understand more of how they work, what frameworks get used and see if creating a game was something I could do. It allowed me to be creative and was lots of fun to create!

### Run python3 file_name.py in the terminal to run the file.

# Development Environment

There was a variety of tools I used for this project. The main tool in running my code is python arcade. Python arcade has a lot of built-in resources for the user and good tutorials to follow along to learn more about how to use it. The built-in resources were very helpful to add some things like sounds to my game. I also used the built-in maps to test out my game. Another great tool I used was Tiled. This is a gaming software that takes tilesets and makes it so the user can create their own game map. I also used photoshop to help me create tilesets to be used in tiled. Youtube is als oan awesome tool to watch tutorials on how to use a lot of this software because it was so new to me.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I want to add bad guys that the user needs to avoid.
* I want to spend some time figuring out how to create multiple levels and have the user move onto the next level. 
* After I have several levels I want the user to be able to save and load their game so that they can start on other levels.
